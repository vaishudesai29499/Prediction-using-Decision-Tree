# Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm.


This is a task that perform the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes).
